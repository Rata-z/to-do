# TO-DO App

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Install the latest version of Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node.js comes with npm. Check if you have it installed by running:
  ```bash
  npm --version
  ```
- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed locally. You can download it [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- **Android/IOS Emulator**: Install Xcode from the Mac App Store. Install Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio), then set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) using the AVD Manager.

## Nest Server Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this project to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rata-z/to-do.git
cd server
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

You need to set up environment variables for the application to run properly. Inside project create `.env` file, open it and configure the following variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string. It should look like:
  ```bash
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public
  ```

Ensure the `DATABASE_URL` points to a valid PostgreSQL database.

### 4. Set Up PostgreSQL

Create local databes with postgres server:

```bash
createdb my_database
```

Make sure the database name matches the one in your `.env` file.

### 5. Run Prisma Migrations

Apply the existing Prisma migrations to set up your database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This command will apply the migrations found in the `prisma/migrations` folder to your database.

### 6. Generate Prisma Client

Ensure that the Prisma client is generated by running:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This command will create the Prisma Client used by the application to interact with the database.

### 7. Start the Application

Finally, run the application:

```bash
npm run start
```

By default, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 8. Tests
Optionally, to confirm that everything is working as expected, you can run the available tests in the project.
#### Run Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test
```
#### Run E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
## React Native Installation
Hereâ€™s the complete **README.md** file for your React Native app that uses a backend API server:

---

# React Native App

This is a **React Native** mobile application that communicates with a backend API (NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL). This README provides a detailed guide on how to set up, run, and develop the React Native app locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running this React Native app, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

### 1. **Node.js & npm/yarn**
- Install the latest version of **Node.js** from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Use either **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** as your package manager.

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
# or if using yarn:
yarn --version
```

### 2. **React Native CLI or Expo CLI**
- **React Native CLI**: Install the React Native CLI globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g react-native-cli
  ```
- **Expo CLI** (if the app uses Expo): Install the Expo CLI globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

### 3. **iOS or Android Emulator**
To run the app locally, you need an iOS or Android emulator:

- **iOS Emulator (macOS only)**:
  - Install **Xcode** from the Mac App Store.
  - Open Xcode, go to **Preferences > Components**, and install the desired iOS simulator (e.g., iPhone 14).
  
- **Android Emulator**:
  - Install **Android Studio** from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).
  - Use the **AVD Manager** in Android Studio to set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD).

For detailed instructions on setting up emulators, follow the official [React Native setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### 4. **Backend Server (NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL)**
Ensure the backend API server is up and running. The React Native app relies on this backend API for data.

- For **iOS simulators**, the server URL should be `http://localhost:3000`.
- For **Android emulators**, use `http://10.0.2.2:3000` (this points to `localhost` on the host machine from the Android emulator).

Make sure the backend server is running before starting the mobile app.

## Installation React Native

### 1. Open React Native Project

First, go into React Native project on your local machine:

```bash
cd client
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies. You can use either `npm` or `yarn`:

- With npm:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- With yarn:
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

### 3. Configure API Url
If you're not using android emulatr, you will have to change api url. 
```bash
  cd services
  ```
Open `taskSerivce.ts` file and change value of `API_URL`:
```bash
  const API_URL= "http://127.0.0.1:3000/tasks"
  ```
The `API_URL` should match your nest.js server configuration
### 4. Running the App

Start the Expo development environment with:

```bash
expo start
```
or
```bash
npm run start
```

You can scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your phone, or use an emulator to open the app.
